Here is an example of a `src/models.py` file for a student management system, following production-ready quality, proper documentation, and best practices:
```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

class Student(models.Model):
    """Student model"""

    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    address = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

class Course(models.Model):
    """Course model"""

    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
    students = models.ManyToManyField(Student, related_name='courses')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
In this example, we have defined two models: `Student` and `Course`. The `Student` model has fields for the student's first name, last name, email, phone number, address, and a `__str__()` method that returns a string representation of the student (e.g., "John Smith").

The `Course` model has fields for the course name, description, start date, end date, and a many-to-many relationship with the `Student` model. The `__str__()` method for the `Course` model returns the course name.

In addition to defining the models, we have also provided proper documentation for each field and the relationships between them. This makes it easier for other developers to understand how the data should be structured and used in the system.
