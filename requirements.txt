# Student Management System Dependencies

This file specifies the necessary libraries and their required versions for the Student Management System built with Python. These dependencies are essential for the system to function properly and ensure that it is of a high standard. Here is an overview of what each line in the requirements file represents:

1. Flask (~1.0) - This line specifies the version of the Flask web framework, which is used to build the student management system's RESTful API. The tilde symbol (~) means that we require a specific version of Flask, but are not picky about which one.
2. SQLAlchemy (>=1.3, <2) - This line specifies the minimum required version of SQLAlchemy, as well as an upper bound of less than version 2. We are using this library to interact with our database and perform CRUD operations. The greater-than or equal to symbol (>=) means that we require at least version 1.3, but can also work with later versions.
3. psycopg2-binary (~2.7.4) - This line specifies the binary version of the PostgreSQL driver for Python, which is used by SQLAlchemy to interact with our database. The tilde symbol (~) again means that we require a specific version of this library, but are not picky about which one.
4. Flask-SQLAlchemy (~2.3.2) - This line specifies the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension for Flask, which provides an object-relational mapper (ORM) for working with databases using SQLAlchemy. The tilde symbol (~) again means that we require a specific version of this library, but are not picky about which one.
5. Flask-Marshmallow (~0.19.0) - This line specifies the Flask-Marshmallow extension for Flask, which provides a lightweight layer for converting Python objects to and from JSON. The tilde symbol (~) again means that we require a specific version of this library, but are not picky about which one.
6. Flask-JWT (~0.3.2) - This line specifies the Flask-JWT extension for Flask, which provides support for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). We use this library to implement token-based authentication in our system. The tilde symbol (~) again means that we require a specific version of this library, but are not picky about which one.
7. PyJWT (>=2.1, <3) - This line specifies the PyJWT library, which provides support for creating and verifying JWTs. We use this library to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens in our system. The greater-than or equal to symbol (>=) means that we require at least version 2.1 of this library, but can also work with later versions.
8. Flask-Migrate (~2.6.0) - This line specifies the Flask-Migrate extension for Flask, which provides support for database migrations using Alembic. We use this library to manage our database schema changes and ensure that our system is always in a consistent state. The tilde symbol (~) again means that we require a specific version of this library, but are not picky about which one.
9. alembic (>=1.5, <2) - This line specifies the Alembic library, which provides support for database migrations using Python scripts. We use this library to generate and apply database schema changes in our system. The greater-than or equal to symbol (>=) means that we require at least version 1.5 of this library, but can also work with later versions.
10. Flask-HTTPAuth (~4.2.0) - This line specifies the Flask-HTTPAuth extension for Flask, which provides support for HTTP Basic and Digest authentication. We use this library to implement token-based authentication in our system. The tilde symbol (~) again means that we require a specific version of this library, but are not picky about which one.
11. pytest (>=3.4, <6) - This line specifies the pytest testing framework for Python, which is used to write and run automated tests for our system. The greater-than or equal to symbol (>=) means that we require at least version 3.4 of this library, but can also work with later versions.
12. coverage (>=5.0, <6) - This line specifies the coverage testing framework for Python, which is used to track test coverage in our system. The greater-than or equal to symbol (>=) means that we require at least version 5.0 of this library, but can also work with later versions.
13. black (>=19.10b0, <20) - This line specifies the black code formatter for Python, which is used to enforce consistent coding styles in our system. The greater-than or equal to symbol (>=) means that we require at least version 19.10b0 of this library, but can also work with later versions.

These dependencies are essential for the Student Management System built with Python to function properly and ensure that it is of a high standard. They provide support for building the RESTful API using Flask, interacting with the database using SQLAlchemy, generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens, managing database schema changes using Alembic, implementing token-based authentication, writing and running automated tests, tracking test coverage, and enforcing consistent coding styles.
