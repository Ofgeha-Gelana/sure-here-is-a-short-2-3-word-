README for Student Management System
=================================

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a student management system that provides various features to help teachers manage their students' data more efficiently. This document will outline the features, functionality, and any necessary installation or setup instructions.

Features
--------

The Student Management System will have the following features:

1. **Student Registration**: Students can register themselves by providing their basic information such as name, email, password, etc. Teachers can also add students to the system through an administrative interface.
2. **Course Management**: Teachers can create and manage courses in the system, including adding course titles, descriptions, and due dates for assignments and projects. Students can enroll in courses and view their assigned tasks and deadlines.
3. **Assignment Submission**: Students can submit assignments and projects to the system, which will be reviewed and graded by teachers. The system will keep track of the submissions and provide feedback to both students and teachers.
4. **Grading System**: The grading system will allow teachers to assign grades to students based on their performance in assignments and projects. The system will also generate reports that display student performance across different courses and classes.
5. **Calendar Integration**: The system will integrate with a calendar service, allowing teachers to schedule meetings, appointments, and events directly from the system. Students can also view their schedules in the system.
6. **Chat System**: A chat system will be integrated into the system, allowing students and teachers to communicate with each other in real-time. This feature will also allow teachers to send messages to students via the system.
7. **File Sharing**: Students can share files and documents with each other within the system, and teachers can view and manage these files as well.
8. **Notification System**: The system will provide notifications to both students and teachers for upcoming deadlines, assignments, events, and other important information.
9. **Reporting**: Teachers can generate reports on student performance across different courses and classes, including grades, attendance, and progress reports.
